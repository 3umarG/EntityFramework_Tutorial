# # Entity Framework Core in .NET

Welcome to the README file for the Entity Framework (EF) Core repository! This repository provides information and resources for working with Entity Framework Core, a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for .NET.

## What is Entity Framework Core?

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform ORM framework developed by Microsoft. It simplifies database access in .NET applications by allowing developers to work with database entities using object-oriented paradigms, while abstracting away the complexities of underlying database interactions.

EF Core supports a wide range of database providers, allowing you to work with various database engines such as SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. It provides powerful features like automatic query generation, change tracking, and migrations, making it a productive choice for data access in .NET applications.

## When to Use Entity Framework Core?

Entity Framework Core is a suitable choice for many scenarios. Here are some situations where EF Core excels:

1. **Rapid Application Development:** EF Core provides a high-level abstraction over the database, allowing developers to focus more on application logic and less on low-level database interactions. It promotes rapid development by providing automatic query generation and database schema management.

2. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** EF Core integrates well with Domain-Driven Design principles, making it easier to map domain entities to database tables. It supports complex mapping scenarios, inheritance hierarchies, and relationships, allowing you to design your database model in a way that aligns with your domain model.

3. **Cross-Platform Development:** EF Core is designed to be cross-platform and works on various operating systems. It can be used in .NET Core and .NET Framework applications, allowing you to target different platforms without changing your data access code significantly.

## Features of EF Core in .NET 6

With the release of .NET 6, Entity Framework Core introduced several new features and improvements. Some key features of EF Core in .NET 6 include:

1. **Performance Improvements:** EF Core in .NET 6 includes performance enhancements that improve query execution and reduce memory allocations, resulting in faster data access operations.

2. **Compiled Models:** EF Core now supports precompiling entity models, resulting in faster startup times and reduced memory footprint.

3. **Global Filters:** Global filters allow you to apply query filters at the entity level, ensuring that certain conditions are applied to all queries involving the entity.

4. **Many-to-Many Relationship Improvements:** EF Core now includes better support for many-to-many relationships, including additional conventions and easier configuration options.

These are just a few highlights of the new features in EF Core for .NET 6. For a comprehensive list of changes and improvements, refer to the official documentation.

## EF Core vs. ADO.NET vs. Dapper

Entity Framework Core, ADO.NET, and Dapper are three different approaches to data access in .NET applications. Here's a brief comparison between them:

**Entity Framework Core:**

- Full-featured ORM with support for various database providers.
- Provides a high-level abstraction, allowing you to work with LINQ queries and abstracted database operations.
- Automatic mapping between database tables and domain objects.
- Suitable for rapid development, code-first approaches, and scenarios where productivity and maintainability are important.

**ADO.NET:**

- Traditional data access approach using raw ADO.NET objects and APIs.
- Requires manual SQL query writing, data mapping, and connection management.
- Provides low-level control over database interactions and performance optimizations.
- Suitable for scenarios that require fine-grained control, raw SQL, and maximum performance.

**Dapper:**

- Lightweight and high-performance micro-ORM.
- Requires manual SQL query writing and mapping.
- Offers greater control over database interactions and performance optimizations.
- Suitable for scenarios that require fine-grained control over SQL queries and execution.

When choosing between EF Core, ADO.NET, and Dapper, consider the specific needs of your project. If productivity, abstraction, and seamless integration with different databases are important, Entity Framework Core is a solid choice. If you have performance-sensitive applications that require fine-grained control over SQL queries, Dapper or ADO.NET might be more suitable.
